# `pymport` vs `PyScript/Pyodide`

Although both projects provide similar functionality, they are completely unrelated with very different design goals:
* `pymport` goal is to allow using standard Python libraries without any modification in Node.js - it brings software such as  `numpy`, `pandas` to Node.js
* `Pyodide` goal is to allow using Python code in a modified interpreter both in the browser and in Node.js - it allows scripting a web page in Python

Comparison:

Software | `pymport` | `Pyodide` |
--- | --- | --- |
Target JS Environment | Node.js | Node.js & Browser  | 
Compatibility | all existing Python libraries w/o modification | libraries ported to `Pyodide` |
Contains binary platform-dependent code | requires binaries for the specific platform, supports Windows, Linux & macOS | fully portable
Python stdlib support | all | most
Existing external environment support | yes, but must compile C++ | no
Special semantics for expressing all missing language features | yes | yes
Performance | native |  3x to 5x slower |
Interpreter support | Standard CPython, latest 3.10 version comes built-in | Modified recent CPython
Using Python objects from JS | yes, with a transparent `Proxy` | yes, with a transparent `Proxy`
Using JS objects from Python | not directly, must copy-convert with `fromJS` before calling Python | yes, with a transparent proxy type from the `js` module
Round-trip conversion of objects restores the original | only Python to JS to Python | both
Calling Python functions from JS | yes | yes 
Calling JS functions from Python | yes | yes
Asynchronous calling from JS to Python | yes | no
Asynchronous calling from Python to JS | no | yes
Interoperability between JS `Promise` and Python `Future` | no | yes
Exception conversion | bi-directional | bi-directional
Program entrypoint | must be JavaScript | JavaScript or Python
Redirecting stdio | no | from Python to JavaScript
Inline Python in JavaScript | only `eval` context | full
Importing `.py` files | may load from the filesystem | may load from an URL
`worker_threads` | yes, all threads share a single Python interpreter | yes, each thread runs a separate Python interpreter
TypeScript support | partial, TypeScript typings for the project itself, but does not generate TypeScript typings for Python packages | partial, TypeScript typings for the project itself, but does not generate TypeScript typings for Python packages
